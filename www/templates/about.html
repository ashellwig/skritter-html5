    <h2>About</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>
        The idea for Skritter was formed at around 3 AM in a dorm room in Beijing. It was Nick's first visit to China, and he was leaving in four hours.
        He was sick, sleep deprived, and mulling over how little Chinese he knew. One of his friends had stayed up all night playing a Nintendo DS game perhaps called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_Center:_Under_the_Knife" target="_blank">"Trauma Center: Under the Knife"</a>.
        Basically the player performs surgery in ninja-infested combat situations.
    </p>

    <p>But it was the way the game was played that interested Nick. Players used a stylus to draw incisions on the screen.
        Now, if only that kind of writing could be applied to learning Chinese characters.
    </p>

    <p>Back in the states, Nick recruited George (the roommate) and Scott (the friend) to join him in his crazy endeavor.
        The trio have been working on Skritter since June 2008, adding the fine teammates you see on the right along the way.
